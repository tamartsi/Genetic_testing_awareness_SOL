# Genetic_testing_awareness_SOL
 
This repository provides code and results from the analysis of the genetic testing survey administered from April 2020 to April 2021 to HCHS/SOL participants. The survey was administered during their annual follow up (AFU) phone call. 

Investigators who apply for the dataset through the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (https://sites.cscc.unc.edu/hchs/) should be able to run the code in this repository, as all original variable names are preserved in precessing the dataset.
